# 🧠 Interpretation & Observations (Based on Your Dataset)
# 🌡️ Temperature Graph (1-Day, 24 hrs)

# The temperature gradually increases through the morning.

# Around midday (~12 PM), it reaches its peak value, showing the hottest period of the day.

# After 12 PM, temperature slowly drops toward evening and night, showing a natural cooling pattern.

# This confirms the diurnal pattern (temperature rises with sunlight, falls after sunset).

# ✅ Say this in viva:

# “From the 24-hour temperature graph, I observed that the temperature peaks around noon and decreases at night — showing the normal day-night variation caused by solar heating.”

# 🌡️ Temperature Graph (2-Day, 48 hrs)

# The same pattern repeats every 24 hours.

# There’s a clear cyclic rise and fall — two peaks roughly 12 hours apart each day.

# On both days, the peak is around 12 PM (hour 12 and 36) and lowest temperature near midnight (hour 24 and 48).

# ✅ Say this in viva:

# “In the 48-hour plot, temperature follows a cyclic pattern repeating every 24 hours — high during the day, low at night — matching natural environmental cycles.”

# 💧 Humidity Graph (1-Day, 24 hrs)

# Humidity shows an inverse pattern to temperature.

# It’s lowest around noon (when temperature is high) and highest at night (when temperature is low).

# This is because warm air holds more moisture, and as temperature drops, humidity percentage increases.

# ✅ Say this in viva:

# “For one day, humidity decreases when temperature increases, and rises again at night — indicating their inverse relationship.”

# 💧 Humidity Graph (2-Day, 48 hrs)

# The pattern repeats daily, confirming a cyclic behavior.

# Around 1 PM (hour 13 and 37), there’s a visible drop in humidity, and it rises again at night.

# This matches real atmospheric behavior — as sunlight increases, humidity temporarily drops.

# ✅ Say this in viva:

# “Humidity graph for two days shows a repeating cycle — humidity falls around 1 PM and increases again at night, repeating the next day.”

# ⚙️ Scatter Plots (1-Day & 2-Day)

# The scatter plots clearly show fluctuations in humidity over time.

# The cyclic nature (rise and fall) is visible as points forming a wave-like trend.

# It helps visualize that humidity variation is time-dependent and periodic.

# ✅ Say this in viva:

# “The scatter plots show how humidity fluctuates periodically throughout the day, increasing at night and decreasing during midday.”

# 🌍 Final Inference

# The readings confirm a natural environmental rhythm driven by sunlight and temperature.

# Both temperature and humidity follow a 24-hour periodic pattern:

# Temperature peaks in daytime.

# Humidity peaks at night.

# This is expected for regions near the equator, where daytime heating and nighttime cooling are consistent.

# ✅ Say this to conclude:

# “Overall, the IoT data visualization clearly shows a cyclic pattern where temperature and humidity vary inversely over each 24-hour cycle — consistent with natural weather behavior.”

Using IoT devices equipped with temperature and humidity sensors placed in farms — readings were captured automatically every 1 hour.

4️⃣ What sensors are used here?

Temperature Sensor (e.g., DHT11/DHT22, LM35) — measures air temperature in °C.

Humidity Sensor (inbuilt in DHT11/DHT22) — measures percentage of moisture in ai
